- 1. Language and Framework Simplicity
	- •	Ease of Learning and Use: Assess how quickly your team can get up to speed with Java 21. 
	  •	Code Readability and Maintainability: Evaluate the simplicity of writing and maintaining code .
	  •	Documentation and Resources: Check the availability and quality of documentation, tutorials, and community support for each language and framework.
- 2. Performance Metrics
	- •	Startup Time: Measure the time it takes for Spring Boot and Micronaut applications to start. Micronaut is generally faster due to its AOT compilation.
	  •	Memory Usage: Compare the memory consumption of Java 21 with Spring Boot and Kotlin with Micronaut, especially under load.
	  •	Request Throughput: Test the frameworks with a realistic load to compare how many requests per second each can handle.
- 3. Concurrency and Asynchronous Handling
	- •	Concurrency Model: Evaluate the ease of handling concurrent tasks with Java 21’s virtual threads vs. Kotlin’s coroutines.
	  •	Asynchronous Programming: Compare how each language and framework handles asynchronous operations, focusing on simplicity and performance.
- 4. Development Speed and Productivity
	- •	Build and Deployment: Assess the ease of setting up, building, and deploying applications in both environments.
	  •	Boilerplate Code: Compare the amount of boilerplate code required to set up a simple REST API or microservice.
	  •	Tooling and IDE Support: Evaluate the tools and Integrated Development Environment (IDE) support available for each language and framework.
- 5. Integration Capabilities
	- •	Database Integration: Test how easily each framework integrates with relational and NoSQL databases.
	  •	Third-party Services: Evaluate how each framework handles integration with common third-party services (e.g., message queues, external APIs).
	  •	Legacy Systems: Consider how easily each language and framework can integrate with existing legacy systems.
- 6. Scalability and Flexibility
	- •	Horizontal Scalability: Assess how easily each framework scales across multiple servers or cloud instances.
	  •	Microservices Support: Evaluate the frameworks’ support for building and managing microservices.
	  •	Cloud Readiness: Check compatibility and ease of deployment to cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure.
- 7. Ecosystem and Community Support
	- •	Library and Framework Support: Compare the availability of libraries and frameworks that enhance development with each language.
	  •	Community and Documentation: Evaluate the size and activity level of the community around each language and framework, as well as the quality of available documentation and resources.
- 8. Security Features
	- •	Built-in Security: Assess the built-in security features provided by Spring Boot and Micronaut (e.g., authentication, authorization).
	  •	Security Best Practices: Evaluate the ease of implementing security best practices in each language and framework.
- 9. Long-term Maintenance and Updates
	- •	Longevity and Stability: Consider the stability and future support for Java 21 and Kotlin, as well as for Spring Boot and Micronaut.
	  •	Upgrade Path: Evaluate the ease of upgrading the POC to newer versions of the language or framework.
- 10. Cost Considerations
	- •	Development Cost: Estimate the cost in terms of time and resources needed to develop with each language and framework.
	  •	Operational Cost: Compare the expected operational costs for running applications built with each language and framework, considering performance and resource usage.
- 11. Testability and Debugging
	- •	Testing Frameworks: Evaluate the available testing frameworks and tools for each language and framework.
	  •	Debugging Support: Consider the debugging capabilities and ease of identifying and fixing issues in the code.
- 12. User Experience
	- •	API Usability: Test the user experience for API consumers. Assess the simplicity and clarity of APIs developed with each language and framework.
	  •	Response Times: Measure the response times of applications built with each framework to ensure they meet performance requirements.
