- 1. Question Every Requirement
  	•	Every requirement must be tied to a specific person, not just a department
  	•	Challenge assumptions and verify each requirement, even from “smart people”
  	•	Requirements should be thoroughly examined to ensure they aren’t unnecessarily adding complexity
  2. Delete Parts and Processes
  	•	Remove as many components and steps as possible from the design/process
  	•	If you’re not adding back at least 10% of deleted items, you haven’t deleted enough
  	•	Start lean and only add back what is absolutely necessary
  3. Simplify and Optimize
  	•	Only optimize after completing steps 1 and 2
  	•	Avoid the common mistake of optimizing things that shouldn’t exist
  	•	Focus on reducing complexity and streamlining remaining processes
  4. Accelerate Cycle Time
  	•	Increase speed only after completing the first three steps
  	•	Don’t accelerate flawed processes (“if you’re digging your grave, don’t dig faster”)
  	•	Look for opportunities to speed up every validated process
  5. Automate
  	•	Automation should be the final step, not the first
  	•	Only automate processes that have been thoroughly validated through steps 1-4
  	•	Ensure bugs and inefficiencies are resolved before automation
  Key Implementation Principles
  Feedback Loops
  	•	Maintain constant communication between design and manufacturing teams
  	•	Place engineers close to production lines for real-time feedback
  	•	Focus on throughput and cost metrics
  Measurement
  	•	Track the “idiot index” - ratio of finished component cost to raw material cost
  	•	Monitor cycle times and production efficiency
  	•	Regularly analyze and improve processes
  This methodology has been successfully implemented at both Tesla and SpaceX, leading to significant improvements in manufacturing efficiency and cost reduction.
